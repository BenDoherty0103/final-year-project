# final-year-project
My final year project, written in React Native

# Purpose of the application
This application will, when completed, allow users to make requests for items of any kind
(rideshares, physical items, or support of any kind).

It utilises React Native, coupled with calls to a Firebase database, to perform the functions outlined
in the technical document that goes alongside it, which can be accessed [here](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AiYLpA9Nwykzg4sTKl4RNmEPtgN9Eg?e=hKAqmU).
